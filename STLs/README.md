## Color guide
* [acc] - Printer accent color.
* [base] - Printer base color.
* [transparent] - Transparent color, it should allow the glow to pass-through and can be diffused. Transparent PETG is recommended.
* [rc] - Rosalina Cyan; the best matching color for Oitswilliam's is Polymaker PolyLite ABS teal. This only occur in Rosalina-theme parts.
* If the part name does not have any brackets at the beginning you can use the printer's base color or better use the least used filament to print the part. These parts are mostly hidden on the outside.

##  Printing guidelines
This section tells how to basically configure print settings.
Some parts require a bigger printer to print.
### Settings
These parts require ABS or PETG to print.
Settings and parameters must be set to the following values:
* Layer height 0.2mm
* Layer width of 1.6mm or 4 layer lines
* Infill density of 40%, but,
    * On LED diffusers ([transparent]led-diffuser), the recommended infill density is 100%,
* Any slicers are welcome.
* Some inner parts such as grills requires modifiers to optimize printing performance.
