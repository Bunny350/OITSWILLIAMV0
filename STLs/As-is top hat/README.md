You may print all the parts in this folder, but not this folder's subfolders, in which you may print either one of the versions of side panels, normal, thick or ultra-thick.

### Side panels foam taping
There are requirements in which the thickness the foam tape is needed.
* Thick version requires at least 3mm thick foam tapes.
* Ultra-thick version does not require any foam tapes in the side. It is optional.

## Assembling As-is top hat

Oitswilliam Pang made a simple design that makes the top hat mod assembly easy, these mount covers are directional, and they need to be faced. Front and back has mount offsets, while the side spacing brackets are thicker.

Re-printing V0.1 top hat is not required, if you have one that isn't been disassembled or salvaged.

Before attaching the corners, they need to be assembled as a ring or halo.

If you want the cam lock feature with this mod, you can attach M3x10mm screws to the bottom hole of the front corners. In V0.2 assembly guide page 232, the screws needs to be spaced and is fixed at 5mm.

To assemble the ring or halo, you attach the spacing brackets to the corners, and secure it with 2 M2x10mm self-tapping screws on each corner, or 4 on each side / corners (16 total).

Then you combine the spacing brackets first, by mounting them with *spacer-holder*, and secure with 2 M3x6mm screws per side (8 total).

This is then you can attach the ring or halo assembly that has corners with M3x12 screws in V0.1 assembly manual, and you may follow the rest in V0.2 assembly manual, most specifically back to page 238.
